                    <h5>Scope of Work:</h5>
                
                    <u>The scope of this project includes the following:</u>
                    <br>
                    Designing a modern and responsive website that is user-friendly and accessible on all devices.
                    Developing a content management system that allows you to easily update and manage your website content.
                    Integrating social media channels, online forms, and other interactive features to enhance user engagement.
                    Incorporating search engine optimization techniques to ensure that your website is easily discoverable by search
                    engines.
                    Providing training and support to your staff to ensure that they can effectively manage and maintain the website.
                    
                    <h5>Design Process:</h5>
                    
                    Our design process will involve the following steps:
                    <br>
                    Initial consultation: We will meet with you to discuss your goals, objectives, and design preferences for the website.
                    Information gathering: We will collect all the necessary information about your school, including photos, videos, and
                    other relevant materials.
                    Design concept: Based on the information gathered, we will develop a design concept for the website and present it to
                    you for approval.
                    Development: Once the design is approved, we will proceed with developing the website, including the content management
                    system and other interactive features.
                    Testing: We will test the website on various devices and platforms to ensure that it is functioning as intended.
                    Launch: After testing, we will launch the website and provide training and support to your staff as needed.

                    <h5>Timeline:</h5>
                    The timeline for this project will depend on the complexity of the website and the amount of content to be developed.
                    However, we anticipate that the project will take approximately 2-4 weeks from the start of design to the launch of the
                    website.
                    
                    <h5>Cost:</h5>
                    
                    The cost of the project will depend on the scope of work, design complexity, and any additional features requested.
                    However, we will provide a detailed cost estimate after the initial consultation and before the start of the project.
                    
                    <h5>Conclusion:</h5>
                    
                    We believe that our team has the experience and expertise to create a website that will meet your needs and exceed your
                    expectations. We look forward to the opportunity to work with you on this project and
